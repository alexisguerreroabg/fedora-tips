# 🎵 Play MIDI files in Decibels (GNOME)

By default, GNOME's audio player **"Decibels"** cannot play MIDI files. However, you can enable this functionality by installing the FluidSynth GStreamer plugin.

## 🔧 Installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-fluidsynth
